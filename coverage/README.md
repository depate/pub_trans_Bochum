the city of Bochum. 

The hypothesis to tackle is:

> "I am not connected to the public transport
network" - Elderly guy, at an informational eventing 

The [Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.org) and the analysis therein will visualise
the isochrones for public transport stations, busses and trains alike of
BOGESTRA AG. Maps of Bochum and isochronal areas will be presented with
temporal distance by feet walking. 

Quality of connection to public transport is set as follows:

* superb: up to three minutes  
* good: up to five minutes 
* average: up to 10 minutes
* mediocre: more than 15 minutes
